    "description": "In this task, subjects are presented with 18 stimuli composed of three dimensions: 3 shapes, 3 orientations and 2 colored borders. Subjects had to learn one of three key responses for each of the 18 stimuli. In the 'flat' condition, the 18:3 mapping was arbitrary, requiring subjects to individually learn each of the 18 associations. In a hierarchical condition, the colored borders indicated whether 'orientation' or 'shape' determined the response. This simplifies performance if subjects learn this hierarchical structure.",
